- declarative command API
  + drop LineItem and EllipseItem once the same can be achieved via PathItem { MoveTo { ... } LineTo { ... } }
  + count/at/etc. for the commands property

- linear gradient for filling
  + like GL paint engine but generate color table via GL?

- When QQuickItem::antialiasing() is true, do something smart, like QQuickRectangle
  (multisampling on the entire window is not necessarily affordable)

- other gradients

- NVPR

- demo app with QuickControls2 and perf comparision (canvas/painteditem vs. paths)

- examples, tests, etc.
