Qt experiments for GL_NV_path_rendering, targeting both OpenGL 4.3+ and OpenGL ES 3.1+.

It is combined with a few functions from Direct State Access and Separable
Shader Objects. The latter is essential to function on OpenGL ES as well.

Verified on Windows (OpenGL 4.5) and the Drive CX platform (OpenGL ES 3.2).
